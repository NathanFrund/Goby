# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current TopicRegistry system suffers from inconsistent usage patterns where developers bypass the registry and use magic strings directly in code. This leads to runtime errors, lack of compile-time safety, and poor maintainability. A professional topic management system is needed that enforces compile-time safety, provides centralized topic definitions, and prevents the use of magic strings throughout the codebase.

## Glossary

- **Topic_Management_System**: The new centralized system for defining, registering, and using topics throughout the application
- **Topic_Definition**: A strongly-typed topic identifier that can be used at compile-time
- **Topic_Registry**: The central repository that manages all topic definitions and their metadata
- **Magic_String**: Hardcoded string literals used as topic names that bypass the registry system
- **Compile_Time_Safety**: The ability to catch topic-related errors during compilation rather than runtime
- **Publisher**: A component that sends messages to topics
- **Subscriber**: A component that receives messages from topics
- **Module**: An application component that defines and uses topics for communication

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define topics with compile-time safety, so that I can catch topic-related errors during development rather than runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer defines a topic, THE Topic_Management_System SHALL provide a strongly-typed topic identifier
2. WHEN a developer uses an undefined topic, THE Topic_Management_System SHALL generate a compile-time error
3. WHEN a developer misspells a topic name, THE Topic_Management_System SHALL prevent compilation
4. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL eliminate the need for string literals in topic usage
5. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL provide IDE autocompletion for all available topics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a module developer, I want to register topics in a centralized way, so that all topics are discoverable and well-documented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a module defines topics, THE Topic_Management_System SHALL register them in a central registry
2. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL prevent duplicate topic registrations
3. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL provide metadata for each topic including description and usage examples
4. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL support topic discovery through programmatic interfaces
5. WHERE a topic is registered, THE Topic_Management_System SHALL validate the topic definition

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use topics consistently across publishers and subscribers, so that message routing works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Publisher publishes to a topic, THE Topic_Management_System SHALL use the same identifier as Subscribers
2. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL prevent the use of Magic_String topic names in Publishers
3. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL prevent the use of Magic_String topic names in Subscribers
4. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL provide a unified interface for topic usage across all components
5. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL maintain topic name consistency across the entire application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to inspect and debug topic usage, so that I can troubleshoot message routing issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL provide a CLI tool for listing all registered topics
2. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL display topic metadata including descriptions and examples
3. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL show topic usage statistics when available
4. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL support filtering topics by module or category
5. WHERE debugging is needed, THE Topic_Management_System SHALL provide topic validation utilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from the current TopicRegistry system, so that existing functionality continues to work during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL provide backward compatibility with existing Topic interface
2. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL support gradual migration from Magic_String usage
3. WHEN migrating existing topics, THE Topic_Management_System SHALL preserve existing topic names
4. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL provide migration utilities for converting Magic_String usage
5. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL maintain existing pub/sub functionality during migration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want topics to be organized by module, so that I can easily find and manage topics related to my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL organize topics by Module ownership
2. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL provide namespacing to prevent topic name conflicts
3. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL support module-specific topic discovery
4. WHERE topics are related, THE Topic_Management_System SHALL provide grouping mechanisms
5. THE Topic_Management_System SHALL enforce naming conventions within modules
