# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for refactoring Goby's command-line interface to use the Cobra CLI framework. The goal is to unify the existing disparate CLI tools (`cmd/server` and `cmd/topics`) into a cohesive, professional command-line experience that follows modern CLI conventions and provides room for future expansion.

## Glossary

- **Goby_CLI**: The unified command-line interface for the Goby application
- **Cobra_Framework**: The Go CLI library that provides command structure, help generation, and flag management
- **Legacy_Commands**: The existing CLI implementations in `cmd/server` and `cmd/topics`
- **Root_Command**: The main `goby` command that serves as the entry point
- **Subcommand**: A command nested under the root or another command (e.g., `goby scripts extract`)
- **Backward_Compatibility**: Ensuring existing command invocations continue to work during transition

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified CLI interface so that I can access all Goby functionality through consistent commands and help systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Goby_CLI SHALL provide a single `goby` binary that replaces all existing command-line tools
2. THE Goby_CLI SHALL implement all functionality currently available in Legacy_Commands
3. THE Goby_CLI SHALL provide consistent help documentation across all commands using Cobra_Framework
4. THE Goby_CLI SHALL follow standard CLI conventions for command structure and flag naming
5. THE Goby_CLI SHALL support command completion for shells that support it

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the server functionality to remain the default behavior so that existing deployment scripts continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no subcommand is specified, THE Goby_CLI SHALL execute the server functionality as the default action
2. THE Goby_CLI SHALL maintain all existing server configuration options and environment variable support
3. THE Goby_CLI SHALL preserve all existing server startup behavior and logging output
4. WHERE existing deployment scripts use `./goby-server`, THE Goby_CLI SHALL continue to work when renamed to `goby-server`

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want script management commands organized under a dedicated subcommand so that script-related operations are discoverable and logically grouped.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Goby_CLI SHALL provide a `scripts` subcommand that groups all script-related operations
2. THE Goby_CLI SHALL implement `goby scripts extract <directory>` with all current extraction functionality
3. THE Goby_CLI SHALL support `goby scripts list` to display available embedded scripts
4. THE Goby_CLI SHALL provide `goby scripts validate` to check script syntax and dependencies
5. WHERE the `--extract-scripts` flag is used, THE Goby_CLI SHALL continue to support it for Backward_Compatibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want topic management commands accessible through the unified CLI so that I don't need separate binaries for different operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Goby_CLI SHALL provide a `topics` subcommand that includes all current topic functionality
2. THE Goby_CLI SHALL implement `goby topics list` with identical output to the current `topics list` command
3. THE Goby_CLI SHALL implement `goby topics get <name>` with identical functionality to the current command
4. THE Goby_CLI SHALL maintain the same tabular output format for topic listings
5. THE Goby_CLI SHALL provide enhanced help documentation for topic commands

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive help and documentation so that I can discover and use CLI features without referring to external documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Goby_CLI SHALL provide `goby help` that displays an overview of all available commands
2. THE Goby_CLI SHALL support `goby <command> --help` for detailed help on any command or subcommand
3. THE Goby_CLI SHALL include usage examples in help output for complex commands
4. THE Goby_CLI SHALL provide command completion suggestions when available
5. THE Goby_CLI SHALL display version information with `goby version`

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want backward compatibility during the transition so that existing scripts and deployment processes are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Goby_CLI SHALL support all existing command-line flags and arguments in their current form
2. WHERE Legacy_Commands are invoked with existing syntax, THE Goby_CLI SHALL execute the equivalent functionality
3. THE Goby_CLI SHALL provide deprecation warnings for legacy flag usage while maintaining functionality
4. THE Goby_CLI SHALL maintain identical exit codes and error messages for existing functionality
5. THE Goby_CLI SHALL support gradual migration by allowing both old and new command syntax simultaneously

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want extensible command structure so that new CLI features can be added easily in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Goby_CLI SHALL use Cobra_Framework's command registration system for easy extension
2. THE Goby_CLI SHALL organize commands in a hierarchical structure that supports nested subcommands
3. THE Goby_CLI SHALL provide a consistent pattern for adding new command categories
4. THE Goby_CLI SHALL separate command logic from CLI framework concerns for maintainability
5. THE Goby_CLI SHALL support plugin-style command registration for modular development
