# Requirements Document

## Introduction

After refactoring the database layer, several tests are failing due to changes in dependencies, topic registration conflicts, and context management issues. This feature addresses the systematic fixing of these test failures to ensure the codebase remains stable and all tests pass.

## Glossary

- **Script_Engine**: The system component responsible for executing embedded scripts with security and context management
- **Topic_Manager**: The system component that manages pub/sub topic registration and validation
- **WebSocket_Bridge**: The system component that handles WebSocket connections and message routing
- **Test_Suite**: The collection of automated tests that verify system functionality
- **Context_Manager**: The system component that manages script execution contexts and isolation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all script engine context tests to pass, so that I can trust the script execution system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Script_Engine creates execution contexts, THE Script_Engine SHALL populate all standard functions without nil pointer dereferences
2. WHEN the Script_Engine executes scripts with timeout, THE Script_Engine SHALL handle timeout scenarios without panicking
3. WHEN the Context_Manager validates contexts, THE Context_Manager SHALL properly estimate memory usage for all variable types
4. WHEN the Script_Engine processes function calls, THE Script_Engine SHALL ensure all function references are properly initialized

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests to run without topic registration conflicts, so that I can verify the system works end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests initialize WebSocket topics, THE Topic_Manager SHALL prevent duplicate topic registration errors
2. WHEN multiple test cases run in sequence, THE Topic_Manager SHALL properly clean up registered topics between tests
3. WHEN the WebSocket_Bridge starts, THE WebSocket_Bridge SHALL register topics only if they are not already registered
4. WHEN test fixtures are created, THE Test_Suite SHALL ensure topic isolation between test cases

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want WebSocket bridge tests to pass validation, so that I can verify WebSocket functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN framework topics are created for testing, THE Topic_Manager SHALL validate topics without module requirements
2. WHEN WebSocket bridge tests create mock topics, THE Test_Suite SHALL create topics that comply with framework topic validation rules
3. WHEN topic validation occurs, THE Topic_Manager SHALL properly distinguish between framework and module topic requirements
4. WHEN bridge tests run, THE WebSocket_Bridge SHALL handle topic validation errors gracefully
