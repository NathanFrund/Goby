# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix script engine context nil pointer dereferences

  - Fix the `addStandardFunctions` method to properly initialize all function references
  - Add null checks in the `ExecuteWithContext` method before accessing Input fields
  - Fix the timeout handling mechanism to prevent panics in context creation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Improve topic registration conflict resolution

  - [x] 2.1 Implement idempotent topic registration in WebSocket topics

    - Modify `RegisterTopics()` function to check for existing registrations before attempting to register
    - Add error handling to gracefully handle "already registered" errors
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

  - [x] 2.2 Create test-specific topic cleanup utilities
    - Add cleanup functions to properly reset topic manager state between tests
    - Implement test isolation mechanisms for topic registration
    - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Fix WebSocket bridge test validation issues

  - [x] 3.1 Fix mock topic creation to comply with framework validation rules

    - Remove module assignments from framework-scoped mock topics
    - Ensure test topics follow proper naming conventions and scope rules
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

  - [x] 3.2 Improve test fixture setup and cleanup
    - Create isolated topic managers for each test case
    - Add proper cleanup mechanisms to prevent state leakage between tests
    - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Enhance integration test infrastructure

  - [x] 4.1 Fix integration test helper topic registration

    - Modify `setupIntegrationTest` to handle duplicate topic registration gracefully
    - Add proper error handling and cleanup for WebSocket bridge initialization
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

  - [x] 4.2 Implement proper test isolation mechanisms
    - Create test-specific instances of topic managers and pub/sub systems
    - Add comprehensive cleanup procedures for integration tests
    - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Add regression tests and validation
  - Write additional tests to prevent future regressions of these issues
  - Add comprehensive test coverage for edge cases in context management
  - Create documentation for proper test setup and cleanup procedures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1_
